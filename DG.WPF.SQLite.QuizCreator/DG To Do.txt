Implement functionality to save database file to DropBox (this will save having two Windows explorer sessions open and potentially accidentally
 overwriting the wrong file)

Number of questions in quiz stats seems to be building each time the quiz is started (see first JavaScript quiz)

Provide functionality to edit Questions and Answers as you go through the quiz

Add a preferences option to modify default directory similar to this:

	  private void btnSQLSave_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        { 
            // Persist user settings
            DG.WPF.SQLite.Quiz.Properties.Settings.Default.DefaultDirectory = tbSQLServer.Text;

            try
            {
                Configuration config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.None);
                config.Save(ConfigurationSaveMode.Modified, true);
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("There was an error writing the connection string to the app.config: " + ex.Message);
            }
        }

Functionality to create a new database file with the correct tables and skeleton data in place

Getting SQLite to run in WPF application
========================================
Had to download sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3080301.zip
from
http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
and unzip to reveal:
sqlite3.dll

dropped this in:
C:\Development\DG.WPF.SQLite.QuizCreator\bin\Debug
set project properties to build x86
problem seems to be resolved.

Deployed Application Crashing 
=============================
Copied SQLite3.dll to project directory and specified content and copy always. This seems to deploy the dll with the application which resolved the issue.
